                <p class="h_14pt"><i>There are 2 kinds of appeals with Wellcare by Health Net</i></p>

                <p>Standard Appeal – We’ll give you a written decision on a standard appeal within 30 days after we get
                    your appeal.
                    Our
                    decision might take longer if you ask for an extension, or if we need more information about your
                    case. We’ll tell
                    you
                    if we’re taking extra time and will explain why more time is needed. If your appeal is for payment
                    of a medical
                    service/item you’ve already received, we’ll give you a written decision within 60 days.
                </p>

                <p>Fast Appeal – We’ll give you a decision on a fast appeal within 72 hours after we get your appeal.
                    You can ask for a
                    fast appeal if you or your doctor believe your health could be seriously harmed by waiting up to 30
                    days for a
                    decision.
                    You cannot request an expedited appeal if you are asking us to pay you back for a medical
                    service/item you’ve
                    already
                    received.</p>

                <p>We’ll automatically give you a fast appeal if a doctor asks for one for you or if your doctor
                    supports your request.
                    If
                    you ask for a fast appeal without support from a doctor, we’ll decide if your request requires a
                    fast appeal. If we
                    don’t give you a fast appeal, we’ll give you a decision within 30 days.</p>

                <p class="h_14pt">How to ask for an appeal with Wellcare by Health Net</p>

                <p><span class="h_12pt">Step 1:</span> You, your representative, or your doctor [provider] must ask us
                    for an appeal.
                    Your request must include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your name</li>
                    <li>Address</li>
                    <li>Member number</li>
                    <li>Reasons for appealing</li>
                    <li>Whether you want a Standard or Fast Appeal (for a Fast Appeal, explain why you need one).</li>
                    <li>Any evidence you want us to review, such as medical records, doctors’ letters (such as a
                        doctor’s supporting
                        statement
                        if you request a fast appeal), or other information that explains why you need the medical
                        service/item. Call
                        your
                        doctor if you need this information.</li>
                </ul>





                <p>If you’re asking for an appeal and missed the deadline, you may ask for an extension and should
                    include your reason
                    for
                    being late.</p>

                <p>We recommend keeping a copy of everything you send us for your records. You can ask to see the
                    medical records and
                    other
                    documents we used to make our decision before or during the appeal. At no cost to you, you can also
                    ask for a copy
                    of
                    the guidelines we used to make our decision.</p>
