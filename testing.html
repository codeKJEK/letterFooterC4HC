<p class="big">Important Information About Your Appeal Rights</p>

<p class="big">There are 2 kinds of appeals with Wellcare by Health Net</p>

<p>Standard Appeal – We’ll give you a written decision on a standard appeal within 30 days after we get your appeal. Our
    decision might take longer if you ask for an extension, or if we need more information about your case. We’ll tell
    you
    if we’re taking extra time and will explain why more time is needed. If your appeal is for payment of a medical
    service/item you’ve already received, we’ll give you a written decision within 60 days.
</p>

<p>Fast Appeal – We’ll give you a decision on a fast appeal within 72 hours after we get your appeal. You can ask for a
    fast appeal if you or your doctor believe your health could be seriously harmed by waiting up to 30 days for a
    decision.
    You cannot request an expedited appeal if you are asking us to pay you back for a medical service/item you’ve
    already
    received.
</p>

<p>We’ll automatically give you a fast appeal if a doctor asks for one for you or if your doctor supports your request.
    If
    you ask for a fast appeal without support from a doctor, we’ll decide if your request requires a fast appeal. If we
    don’t give you a fast appeal, we’ll give you a decision within 30 days.
</p>

<p class="big">How to ask for an appeal with Wellcare by Health Net</p>

<p>Step 1: You, your representative, or your doctor [provider] must ask us for an appeal. Your request must include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Address</li>
    <li>Member number</li>
    <li>Reasons for appealing</li>
    <li>Whether you want a Standard or Fast Appeal (for a Fast Appeal, explain why you need one).</li>
    <li>Any evidence you want us to review, such as medical records, doctors’ letters (such as a doctor’s supporting
        statement if you request a fast appeal), or other information that explains why you need the medical
        service/item.
        Call your doctor if you need this information.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re asking for an appeal and missed the deadline, you may ask for an extension and should include your reason
    for
    being late.
</p>


<p>We recommend keeping a copy of everything you send us for your records. You can ask to see the medical records and
    other documents we used to make our decision before or during the appeal. At no cost to you, you can also ask for a
    copy of the guidelines we used to make our decision.
</p>

<p>Step 2: Mail, fax, or deliver your appeal.</p>

<p>If you ask for an appeal and we continue to deny your request for a medical service/item, we’ll automatically send
    your
    case to an independent reviewer. If the independent reviewer denies your request, the written decision will explain
    if
    you have additional appeal rights.
