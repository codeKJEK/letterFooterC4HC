                    after we get

                    you

                    service/item you’ve already received, we’ll give you a written decision within <b>60 days</b>.

                <p><b>Fast Appeal</b> – We’ll give you a decision on a fast appeal within <b>72 hours</b> after we get
                    your appeal. You
                    can ask for a

                <p class="tahoma-14">How to ask for an appeal with Wellcare by Health Net</p>

                <p><span class="tahoma-12">Step 1:</span> You, your representative, or your doctor [provider] must ask
                    us for an appeal.
                    Your request must include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Your name</li>
                    <li>Address</li>
                    <li>Member number</li>
                    <li>Reasons for appealing</li>
                    <li>Whether you want a Standard or Fast Appeal (for a Fast Appeal, explain why you need one).</li>
                    <li>Any evidence you want us to review, such as medical records, doctors’ letters (such as a
                        doctor’s supporting
                        statement if you request a fast appeal), or other information that explains why you need the
                        medical
                        service/item.
                        Call your doctor if you need this information.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you’re asking for an appeal and missed the deadline, you may ask for an extension and should
                    include your reason
                    for
                    being late.
                </p>


                <p>We recommend keeping a copy of everything you send us for your records. You can ask to see the
                    medical records and
                    other documents we used to make our decision before or during the appeal. At no cost to you, you can
                    also ask for a
                    copy of the guidelines we used to make our decision.
